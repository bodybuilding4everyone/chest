	<p>Some people might argue that this exercise is meant for the purpose of building a back, but it can definitely help you build a better chest as well. Apart from the other chest workouts, the dumbbell pullover is one of the few exercises that provides its focus on the chest from a completely different angle and with a top to bottom contraction</p>
	<p><b><big>How to do it:</big></b>Lie on a bench with your upper back, head and neck supported and your feet flat on the floor. Hold a dumbbell with your arms extended above your face. Slowly lower the dumbbell backward, maintaining a slight bend in your elbows and allowing them to come down to a point at which they align with your ears. When you’ve stretched as far as you can without bending your elbows, flex through your chest and lats to reverse direction and bring the dumbbell back overhead.</p>
